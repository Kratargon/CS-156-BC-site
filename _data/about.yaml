  COVID Retrospective Analysis

Abstract: >
  The subject of this research is to consider several machine learning methods for modelling the 
  spread of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID 19) and agregate these models to create an effective retrospective
  analysis of the impact of policy decisions around the country on the spread of the disease in 
  each state. A Gradient Boosted MultiOutput Regressor was used to project the number of COVID-19 
  cases and deaths that occurred when a policy was implemented and when it was not. Policy 
  implementation was simulated by modeling that the policy had been in effect for the duration of 
  the pandemic while the other policies are modeled to be as they were In real life.  While 
  policies have some impact on the reduction of COVID metric, the model ultimately found policy 
  effectiveness to be quite limited relative to state characteristics (such as population density 
  and characteristics) and previous metrics.
