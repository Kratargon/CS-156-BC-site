Abstract: >
  The subject of this research is to consider several machine learning methods for modelling the 
  spread of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID 19) and agregate these models to create an effective retrospective
  analysis of the impact of policy decisions around the country on the spread of the disease in 
  each state.
